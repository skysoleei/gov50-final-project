## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to educational policy data in schools across the United States. I want to explore some of the correlations and connections between student test scores, unionization and  student performance through various parts of the country. I am very interested in data concerning the differences in gpd per capital and human capitol amoungst states with district with stronger unions and school committee boards and how it affects the probability of student success and contributions back to their home city.
